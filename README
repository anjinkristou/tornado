The goal of this application is to make advanced todo features available in a simple, clean interface. The app will be fully GTD compatible, but a simpler interface will be availbe if you don't want all fancy features.

Planned features are:
* Contexts (for both tasks and lists. support for multiple contexts)
* Tags
* Lists
* Lists in lists (divide big projects in sub-projects)
* Sharing of tasks/lists between users
* Recurrent tasks
* Difference between todo-lists and lists (lists like "Movies to watch" or "My life goals" should not take focus from your every day tasks.)
* Stuff (List of thoughts and fast notes that eventually become tasks)
* GMail integration (mail pop up in "stuff" and when a task is created the mail will be archived)
* Calendar integration (get tasks based on some criteria in your calendar)
* Posibility to sort tasks based on current energy, time available (GTD)
